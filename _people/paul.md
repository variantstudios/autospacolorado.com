title: Paul
name: Paul
bio: Paul, a former mobile detailer himself, joined our team in order to expand his
  knowledge of the industry and be challenged along the way. As one of our main detailers,
  Paul continually pushes himself to excel in his craft and hopes that with growth
  in himself, he will begin to climb the ranks here as well. Since starting he has
  already expanded his skillset to include Ceramic Coating prep and applications.
  When not caring for his daughter, he can be found browsing detailing articles, researching
  new trends and tech, as well as working on himself, but let's be honest... he eats,
  sleeps and breathes detailing!
