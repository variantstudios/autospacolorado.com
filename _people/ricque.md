name: Ricque Wirth
bio: >-
  Wearing a variety of hats in this operation, Ricque is the glue that holds it
  all together and the actual BOSS! The list of tasks she handles is too long to
  list, so here are the highlights... Lead Coating Specialist, Buffing
  Afficianado, HR, Customer Service, Clerical & Payroll, as well as Mom (her
  most important job). Ricque's day starts bright and early... 4:30am for health
  and wellness, then ends after putting the kids to bed and finishing paperwork
  at 11:00pm. She is a Rockstar!
