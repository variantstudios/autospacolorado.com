bio: >-
  As a Military Veteran, Ryan utilizes his service knowledge as our Shop
  Manager. He implements a rigorous training structure as the Head of Detailing,
  and has a keen eye for the details, as he is one of our main quality control
  specialists. Like himself, he holds our detailing team to high standards and
  sets daily goals for them to reach. When he's not at work, this single father
  can be found building LEGOS with his son... even though the LEGOS are actually
  his!
