Helpful **Winter** Tips to Keep You **Safe**<br>1\. HAVE YOUR **CAR** SERVICED FOR WINTER CONDITIONS<br>Before you hit any harsh winter conditions, have your vehicle serviced to prepare it for the challenges winter can pose.<br>~Battery – Battery power decreases as the temperature drops, meaning that it takes more power to start your car in the winter. If your<br>battery is already having problems, your risk of breaking down increases. It is recommended that your auto care provider installs a battery at<br>or above 600 CCA for optimal winter performance.<br>~Cooling system – It is recommended to maintain a ratio between 50/50 and 70/30 of antifreeze to water. Ask your technician what<br>antifreeze should be used for your vehicle and the appropriate coolant-to-water ratio to prevent against corrosion and potential freezing.<br>~Brakes – While cold weather doesn’t necessarily hurt your brakes, a thorough inspection can ensure the best performance when driving in<br>winter conditions.<br>~Belts, hoses, spark plugs, wires and cables – These can go bad at any time of year, but if they go bad during the winter, you could be<br>stranded in a very cold place for a very long time.<br>2\. SWITCH TO **WINTER** TIRES<br>It’s possible to use all-season tires in winter conditions however, this won’t offer you the maximum performance you may need in your<br>environment.<br>If you live in a place that experiences extremely cold winter temperatures, it is recommended that you install winter tires when winterizing<br>your car. When the temperature consistently hovers around or below freezing, the rubber compounds in non-winter tires harden, decreasing<br>the tire’s ability to grip the road. Winter tires use special compounds engineered to resist hardening in cold temperatures, providing better<br>traction in ice, snow, slush, and even dry pavement.<br>If you live in an area that doesn’t normally have intense winters, all-season tires should be acceptable. However, if you live somewhere with<br>harsh winters or regularly visit places that do, winter tires are the safest choice for you.<br>3\. MAINTAIN TIRE PRESSURE<br>Every 10&deg; change in ambient temperature could mean a gain or loss of 1 PSI. This means you should check pressure more regularly during<br>winter and refill your tires as needed. Appropriate pressure for your tires can be found on the tire placard in the driver’s side door jamb or in<br>your vehicle owner’s manual.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;![](/assets/images/blog-photo-2.jpg){: width="301" height="960"}<br>4\. CHECK FOR CHANGING TEMPERATURES THAT COULD AFFECT TRACTION<br>Before going out for a long winter drive, check to see how temperatures may change while you’re out. Changing temperatures can affect both<br>your traction and driving ability if there is a sudden change that you’re not prepared for.<br>For example, how you should drive in 0&deg; weather is much different than how you can drive in 32&deg; **weather**. You generally have better traction<br>at 0&deg; than you do at 32&deg; due to surfaces becoming more slippery at these higher winter temperatures.<br>5\. INSTALL WINTER WIPERS<br>These come equipped with rubber that keeps ice from collecting on the blades. Just be sure to remove them when spring rolls around. As<br>winter wipers are heavier than regular ones, keeping them on all the time increases the load on the wiper motor.<br>6\. KEEP WASHER FLUID FULL<br>Replace your windshield wiper fluid often. A single snowstorm can exhaust a large amount of this fluid, so refill the washer reservoir<br>frequently with windshield wiper fluid formulated for winter conditions. If you’re unsure if your washer fluid is the right formula for low<br>temperatures, add a bottle of washer fluid antifreeze to the reservoir. You’ll find it at most auto parts stores.<br>7\. PACK A WINTER **SAFETY** KIT<br>Before heading off on a trip, store common tools and supplies in your car in case of an emergency. Use this infographic below to know what to<br>pack before heading out into the snow.

8\. KEEP THE **GAS** TANK AT LEAST HALF FULL<br>Fill up often\! Keeping gas in the tank is more important in winter than in summer. Why? For one thing, a full tank reduces condensation, which<br>can prevent gas line freeze ups. Not only that, but if you’re ever stranded, your engine may be the only thing to keep you warm until help<br>arrives.<br>9\. KEEP YOUR REAR-WINDOW DEFROSTER IN WORKING ORDER<br>Being unable to see behind you could create unsafe driving conditions. That’s why several states have laws stating that all your windows must<br>be clear of condensation and debris. When winterizing your car, check your rear-window defroster before cold weather arrives to be sure it’s<br>working properly.<br>10\. LEARN WINTER **EMERGENCY** PREPAREDNESS<br>It’s important to know what to do before you are in an emergency in case you ever get stuck. If you get stuck in a winter storm while driving:<br>~Do not leave your car for risk of losing sight of it<br>~Do not run your car for long periods of time. Instead, turn it on long enough to stay warm, and then turn it off again to avoid carbon<br>monoxide poisoning<br>~Put your dome lights on to attract attention<br>11\. LEARN HOW-TO DRIVE IN WINTER CONDITIONS<br>It’s best to know how-to drive in winter conditions before getting on snowy or icy roads. If you need any hands-on help, contact your local<br>driving school to assist:<br>~What gear to drive in on snow and ice<br>~How fast you should drive<br>~Stopping distance you need between vehicles<br>~What to do if you start sliding<br>~Driving uphill or downhill
