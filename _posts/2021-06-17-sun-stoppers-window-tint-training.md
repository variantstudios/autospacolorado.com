<br>*"Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant."*

**\-Robert Louis Stevenson**

We take a great amount of pride in being able to offer premium products and services to our customers. In order to maintain our quality, we must invest in our team's future, as well as their ongoing progress. To stay on the cusp of trends, techniques, and products, we bring in industry specialists, so that our team may learn from the best.&nbsp;

By way of Easley, South Carolina, Garrett Wilson Jr. was gracious enough to make time for our team. Through a rigorous training schedule, Garrett helped mold our new team into efficient tint-focused installers, while also offering wisdom and insight to our more seasoned installers.&nbsp;

Garrett has been involved in multiple aspects of window tinting throughout his career and currently runs one of the first initial Sun Stoppers locations. While the team at the Easley location is small, they are extremely mighty, completing between 22-25 tint tickets a day...talk about being efficient\!&nbsp;

He has developed a teaching regiment that allows for clear and concise course objectives that not only focus on all aspects of a clean and proper install but also overall shop efficiency, as well as customer interaction. With his guidance and our team's thirst for knowledge, he was able to walk each installer through a variety of tests and time trials to gauge their progress, retention, and focus. Upon completion of the training, he provided a very clear and concise scoring system that allowed us to see the areas that needed additional training, as well as the ones where our trainees were already excelling. &nbsp;&nbsp;

To thrive, we must do all we can to give our team the highest level of training possible; that by doing so we are directly giving them a chance to create a livelihood for their future. What began as a gathering of individuals eager to learn the art of tinting, ended up being much more than that... a team of window tinters bonded by a journey of tint-based self-discovery and team unity.&nbsp;
