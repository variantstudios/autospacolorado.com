Do you find **rock chips** to be annoying? Did you know it only takes 1 drive down a Colorado road to get rock chips on the front fascia of your car? We have the perfect solution for you, a clear plastic film that is virtually invisible and will resist rock chipping on your vehicle's paint.&nbsp;**Clear bra** is about **90% effective**, with exceptions... obviously, a sharp or large object hitting your vehicle at high speeds can possibly tear through the material,&nbsp;

This film is commonly known as clear bra or **PPF**(paint protection film). This product is self-healing (scratches begin to disappear with heat due to the reversible polymers in the material). The self-heal top coating is rough .5mil thick, so any scratches past that depth will not be able to fully heal. Our PPF comes with a warranty and will pay for itself in the long run by preserving your factory paint, therefore resulting in a higher resale value on your car. We exclusively offer&nbsp;**Xpel Paint Protective Films**, as they've proven to be the most resilient and consistent within our industry.

*Here are some of the many features and benefits of XPEL's Paint Protection Films:*

**Heat Activated Self-Healing Topcoat**<br>Constructed from an elastomeric polyurethane, ULTIMATE PLUS will self-heal light scratches & swirl marks with a light heat application to the film's surface.

**Non-Yellowing**<br>Our proprietary film formulation will not yellow from UV exposure, ensuring protected areas are nearly invisible.

**Discoloration & Stain Resistant**<br>Don't worry about specs, spots, or splotches from contaminants. ULTIMATE PLUS is stain resistant & will maintain clarity under the harshest conditions.

**Prevents Wear & Tear**<br>Stop rock chips, nicks & scratches in the paint, and keep your vehicle looking as good as the day it rolled off the lot.

**Edge Seal Technology**<br>Lifting & delamination are a thing of the past. Our signature Edge Seal Technology ensures film stays stuck & keeps surfaces protected from contaminants.

Most of our PPF installs are **computer cut**... however, there is a rare occasion when our technician may have to do a custom cut install. Custom install you say? No worries there, our clear bra technician has over 10 years of experience and can do a custom cut without scoring/cutting into your clear coat.

**Benefits**<br>The most valuable benefit of having PPF installed on your vehicle is that the film will preserve your factory finish. We all know a car that has original paint will always be worth more than one that has been repainted\!

We have even had clients run into the side of garages, minor accidents, scuffed up against an object and also had incidents where chemicals have sat on the car for extended periods of time. Thankfully, many have not had to repaint due to clear bra being installed. A simple peel off of the old material and replacement of that area = good as new\!
