# Site information:

- Currently we have Jekyll version 3.0.3 to be used locally and also in our CloudCannon site.
- Make sure you replace the following placeholder graphics:
  - /favicon.ico
  - /siteicon.png
  - /apple-touch-icon.png
  - /touch-icon.png
- A 'robots.txt' file initially set to Disallow everything to avoid getting your site indexed on search engines before it's ready. Once your website is ready to launch remove this robots.txt file and rename the 'USE-WHEN-live--robots.txt' file to 'robots.txt' so it will not tell search engines to not index your site. If you add 'noindex: true' to your the frontmatter of any file it will add it to be not indexed on the robots.txt file.
- A '/301.md' file where you can add your site's 301 reirects.
- A '/404.html' file that will show when when a page can not be found. Feel free to customize the content or remove it.
